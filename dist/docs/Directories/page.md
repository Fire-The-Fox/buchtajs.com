### List of directories used by buchta to function

<br>

<br>

# `.buchta` directory

<br>

### This directory contains stuff generated by buchta and its pluggins

<br>

# `dist` directory

<br>

### This directory contains output of build command
<pre class="language-shell bg-black rounded-md mt-5 bg-opacity-40">
<code>$ bun x buchta build</code></pre>
<br>

<br>

# `public` directory 

<br>

### Files inside this directory should do something with the server rather than serve as static files
### Such as svelte files for preparation or server files

<br>

# `middleware` directory

<br>

### Directory that contains middleware set for routes and all methods
### If specific route and HTTP method already has middlware, it won't be replaced

<br>

# `composables` directory

<br>

### This directory serves like global variables for your pages
### Their content first gets executed by the server and then put into your frontend

<br>

# `plugins` directory

<br>

### This directory is pretty much useless, but put your custom plugins there
### So you won't have too much files in root directory of your project

<br>

# `static` directory 

<br>

### This directory contains files that don't change on their own
### Use this directory just to keep yourself from warnings

<br>

# `templates` directory

<br>

### This directory contains templates for plugins
